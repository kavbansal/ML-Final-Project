# ML-Final-Project

All our code is located inside the Jupyter notebook FinalProject.ipynb, while the more detailed report can be found in Report.ipynb at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Kur89D15z8CVKWAxZGhv3lA-oep6vI4S?usp=sharing

To run the code, first download the dataset from https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf.
Once this is done, ensure that Step 1 of the code has the correct file path. Once the file path is correct, everything should run in order within the notebook.
